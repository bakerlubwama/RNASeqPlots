# RNASeqPlots
Visualising RNA-Seq (mouse) gene expression data for my bioinformatics dissertation project using R

Original paper: Yang et al.

From this paper, there is a csv file: a count matrix showing the raw abundances of mouse genes across different RNA-seq experiments differing by time point, 
each with two replicates.
